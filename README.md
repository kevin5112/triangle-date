# Project 1 CPSC 463
Kevin Chen
CWID: 891094930

Project is written in Python 3, therefore, in order to run it please download and have Python 3 installed to your computer before running.  

to run:

	`python3 triangle.py`
	`python3 date.py`

IMPORTANT: make sure to use `python3` as using `python` might break the program.  Using just `python` without `3` appended to it will cause the program to run using Python 2.	

If there are any questions about getting the project to work, email at kevin5112@csu.fullerton.edu
